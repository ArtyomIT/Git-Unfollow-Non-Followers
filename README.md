# Git-Unfollow-Non-Followers
A script for automatically unfollowing GitHub users who have not followed you

The program uses the GitHub API to verify mutual subscriptions and unsubscribes from users who are not subscribers.

Main features:
- Checking subscriptions: Determines whether the users you subscribe to are subscribed to your account.
- Automatic unsubscribe: Automatically unsubscribes from users who do not reciprocate.

To use the script, you will need to provide your GitHub username and a GitHub token.
